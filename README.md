Math-to-statistics-problem

This is a statistic solution for a mathematical problem.

Draw a triangle, draw a perpendicular line for each side, the intersection point is X, suppose that the angles are not known, what is the probability of X to land inside, outsidem, and in the perimeter of the triangle?

The key here is that the only case of X to land in the inside is when each angle is less than 90 degrees, so I didn't need to use geometry modules for the solution.

For more detailed information, undo the rest print functions.
